### Our Week In-Review

After failing to meet with our clients in the Geography department yet again, we came to the decision to not cater the entire project to their specifications. Now our goal is to create a project that will be more generally useful, expaning on our file-management and video editing capabilities. 

### Key Milestones

#### ** Decisions About New Project Scope **

  Without the pretense of providing a tool for the Geography department, we needed to consider what additional features we want in our project to provide it more a more plausible use case for some user out there. We have decided to lean into the niche as a video-based-project management tool. We will exapnd our non-destructive video editing features, hoping to include more support for editing supported by fluent-ffmpeg. We also want to expand on our file management features, including tags and a more robust search/filter functionality in the future.

  We *may* also attempt to implenet some AI features, most likely just something that provides a summary or transcript of videos that we can use for the purpose of our advanced search/filtering functionality.

#### ** Generally unproductive week... **

  Perhaps due to our loss of a client, this week saw less foreward progress than some others. There was some conceptual work, planning out our next steps foreward, but (at least at the point of writing this), none of our expanded features have been added. I know Josh did work on the Timeline branch, but I am uncertain what exactly that enatials.

  As a result, I don't have any good photos of the app to put here. Instead, enjoy this cat gif.

### What's Next?
We now have even more work to do to simply justify the existence of the project before sprint 3, including all from last post:
  1. The video editor needs to save edits back into json, uploaded to our bucket
  2. Video exporting using fluent-ffmpeg based on our saved json
  3. Finishing implementing user authentication
    - Likely changing a tad, due to no longer being a strictly interally used Augustana app.
And more: 
  4. Expanding search and filtering functionality
    - Likely inlcudes implementing a "tag" system for files
  5. Adding more video editing features
    - Color correction, reversal, mirroring and rotations, and maybe more
  6. AI integration?

We've certainly got our work cut out for us...
