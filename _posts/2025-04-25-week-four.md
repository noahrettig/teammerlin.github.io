### Our Week In-Review

By/after sprint two we had three branches to merge together and a sizeable amount of refactoring; several chunks of code were near-copied across multiple locations so we have been working on making our code less WET.

### Key Milestones

#### **Everything is back in Main, for now :**

  Google authentication and JSON/project usage have been merged into main where the video editor was already (on a test page).

  The file storage structure has been mostly solidifed (on a branch) and then merged into main; we now require a project name to be chosen when uploading files (can be a new name, which will create a new project), which is used for storing JSON files corresponding to different edited copies of source videos. A base JSON file with no edits is created and placed in the project's folder, on upload, while the actual video goes to a shared Videos folder on our GCS bucket.

### What's Next?

We have a lot of work to do to bring geo-crop to a useful state:
  1. We need to make the video editor interact with / create new JSON files for videos, containing the edits the user has chosen
  2. We need to use fluent-ffmpeg to take in a JSON file (which tells it which mp4 to grab), perform the edits specified by a JSON file, and then pipe the edited video back to the user
     - Also, we need an option to convert the video into a collection of frames on export, which fluent-ffmpeg can also do
  3. We need to integrate google auth with the rest of the project
     - Right now being signed in does not really matter; eventually we want (the ability to have) project access control and tracking of authors in edit logs.
         - While access control is not too necessary for our use case, only seeing projects that you actually need is nice
