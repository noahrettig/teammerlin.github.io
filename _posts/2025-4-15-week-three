### Our Week In-Review

No non-project assignments have been given lately, so our time has been exclusively focused on completion of the main Geo Crop application.

### Key Milestones

#### **Successful Upload and Confirmation of Multiple Simultaneous Files :**

  It is now possible to choose multiple files to upload into the project simultaneously from the local machine and see the confirmation that each one has uploaded successfully as a part of the UI. Upon choosing to "Upload Files", a progress bar for each one will be rendered to the right of the upload button, showing the succeess or failure of the upload, as demonstrated by some lovely test documents in spanish.

#### **Initial UI for Video Editing Page :**

  While not fully embedded into the project's main branch yet, the foundations for both a crop box and video trimming are present on the editing page. Timestamps within the video being edited are also displayed below the video being rendered as well, enabling a more precise trim in tandem with the timestamp values in seconds for the beginning and end of the clip.
  
- **UI Improvements:**  
  Most of the UI is the same as from sprint 1, but there have been several improvements. The most notable ones are the addition of our team logo to the navigation bar, the "About" tab opening the blog in a new tab instead of redirecting the current one, and the "Get Started" button's clickable area on the landing page being corrected from the width of the entire column it occupies to only the button's actual footprint.

  We have also determined a color palette for the final design that both is consistent with the Augustana logo and will automatically adjust based on the user's browser preferences on light versus dark theme. Nothing like some good old Augie blue and gold to get future users hyped about editing underwater go-pro footage!

### Other Things of Note:

#### **Front-end and Back-end Video Editor Functionality**
  
  Upon discovering there are currently issues with the UI library we were planning on using, Blueprint UI, we have decided for the time being to forgo using one, and instead implement all UI elements we need ourselves. Hopefully this doesn't come back to haunt us later...

  As of now, the front-end and back-end work on the video editor has yet to be combined for full functionality. As of now, it is possible to drag the trim markers, but they don't actually affect the video file itself yet, and the crop box doesn't modify video size yet either. On the back end, it is possible to hard code a specific clip out of a chosen video file, but it can't be downloaded from the server once clipped yet. The design and functionality will hopefully be working and successfully paired by Sprint 3.

### What's Next?

Sprint 2 is coming up on Tuesday, April 22, and by then we hope to have completed multiple larger features. Both user authentication via Google sign-in and a fully functioning video editor are in progress, which, upon completion, would solidify several crucial portions of the final application. Implementing many of our UI design choices will also ensure that users can edit their videos in style.

Sprint 2, here we come!
